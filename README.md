### Sub Attack                     

### About
Sub Attack is a 2D arcade adventure that immerses players in an underwater world full of action, developed with the Pygame library. This project was born as a Practical Activity for the Applied Programming Language course, under the guidance of Prof. Vinicius Pozzobon Borin, at Uninter.

This game marks my debut in game development, and in it, each pixel was carefully created with the art of Pixel Art, bringing the characters and the maritime setting to life.

Get ready to explore 2 exciting levels, including challenges in normal and time trial modes. Sub Attack can be enjoyed both individually and in cooperative mode with 2 players. The score of each match is recorded in a SQLite3 database.
